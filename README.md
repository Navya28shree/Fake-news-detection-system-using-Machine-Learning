# Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning

Fake news detection using TF-IDF and an MLP classifier, served via Flask, integrated with NewsAPI and a Chrome extension for real-time article verification.

## Dataset

The dataset files are too large to be hosted on GitHub.

Download them from Google Drive:

- Fake.csv: https://drive.google.com/your-fake-link
- True.csv: https://drive.google.com/your-true-link

Place both files in the same directory as `train_model.py` before running the training script.
