## Dataset

The dataset files are too large to be hosted on GitHub.

Download them from Google Drive:

- Fake.csv: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ItEPkW7jzom6bI166ekhaE-mbpNC11Mt/view?usp=sharing
- True.csv: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BZHQFAUF4ReNxyJZGBNdrOnPLLWQMQz_/view?usp=sharing

Place both files in the same directory as `train_model.py` before running the training script.
